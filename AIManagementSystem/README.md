# AI Management System

## Overview
The AI Management System is a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the processes of model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. This project aims to provide a structured approach to managing AI models throughout their lifecycle.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several services, each responsible for a specific aspect of AI model management:

- **services/model_training**: Contains the application logic for training AI models.
- **services/model_evaluation**: Intended for evaluating the performance of trained models.
- **services/model_deployment**: Responsible for deploying models to production environments.
- **services/model_monitoring**: Monitors the performance of models in production.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIManagementSystem.git
   cd AIManagementSystem
   ```

2. Navigate to the model training service directory:
   ```
   cd services/model_training
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
To run the model training service, you can use Docker:
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t model_training .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker run model_training
   ```

3. Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose:
   Add the following configuration to your `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   model_training:
     build:
       context: ./services/model_training
   ```

### CI/CD
The project includes a CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. This pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes.

### Usage
Refer to the individual service directories for specific usage instructions related to model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.
